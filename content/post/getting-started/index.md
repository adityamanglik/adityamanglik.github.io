Inspired from [Patrick McKenzie](https://www.kalzumeus.com/standing-invitation/).
My email address is reach.aditya.here@ world's most popular email service. I strongly prefer email as a communication method.

Would appreciate if you read [some tips on emailing](https://hbr.org/2016/09/a-guide-to-cold-emailing) first as that would be helpful for both of us.
Look forward to hearing from you!
