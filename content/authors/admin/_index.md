## About Me

Hi! I am a graduate student affiliated with [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/) and [ETH Zürich](https://ethz.ch/en.html). At Columbia University, I am advised by [Prof. Kostis Kaffes](https://stanford.edu/~kkaffes), focusing on the intersection of energy efficiency and security in modern computing systems. At ETH Zürich, I am advised by [Prof. Lana Josipović](https://sites.google.com/view/lanajosipovic) and [Prof. Onur Mutlu](https://people.inf.ethz.ch/omutlu/). 

Before returning to academia, I worked at Oracle Corporation for three years after earning my bachelor’s degree in Electrical Engineering (Hons.) from [BITS Pilani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birla_Institute_of_Technology_and_Science,_Pilani). During my bachelor’s thesis at the [Vienna University of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TU_Wien), I developed a research interest in computer systems under the supervision of [Prof. Muhammad Shafique](https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/academics/divisions/engineering/faculty/muhammad-shafique.html) and [Prof. Surekha Bhanot](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/Pilani/surekha/profile). My current research explores the security, reliability, and energy-efficiency trade-offs in modern computer architectures.
