Hi! I am a graduate student at ETH Zürich, advised by [Prof. Onur Mutlu](https://people.inf.ethz.ch/omutlu/). I am broadly interested in systems, specializing in computer architecture and secure system design.

Before coming to ETH Zürich, I was a Cloud Engineer at Oracle Corporation. I earned a Bachelor’s in Electrical Engineering (Hons.) from [BITS Pilani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birla_Institute_of_Technology_and_Science,_Pilani) and wrote a bachelor's thesis at TU Wien (supervised by [Prof. Muhammad Shafique](https://ti.tuwien.ac.at/ecs/people/shafique) and [Prof. Surekha Bhanot](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/Pilani/surekha/profile)). My prior research work focuses on Non-Volatile Memory microarchitectures for accelerating deep learning workloads.
