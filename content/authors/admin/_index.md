Hi! I am a graduate student in Electrical Engineering at ETH Zürich, working with [Prof. Onur Mutlu](https://ee.ethz.ch/the-department/people-a-z/person-detail.MjIyOTQ5.TGlzdC8zMjc5LC0xNjUwNTg5ODIw.html). I am broadly interested in system design, specializing in computer architecture and secure computing.

Prior to graduate school, I was a Cloud Engineer at Oracle Corporation. I earned a Bachelor’s in Electrical Engineering (Hons.) from [BITS Pilani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birla_Institute_of_Technology_and_Science,_Pilani), India. My bachelor's thesis focused on the Non-Volatile Memory microarchitectures for accelerating deep learning, supervised by [Prof. Muhammad Shafique](https://ti.tuwien.ac.at/ecs/people/shafique) and [Prof. Surekha Bhanot](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/Pilani/surekha/profile).
