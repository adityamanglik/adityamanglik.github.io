Hi! I am a graduate student affiliated with [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/) and [ETH Zürich](https://ethz.ch/en.html). At Columbia University, I am advised by [Prof. Kostis Kaffes](https://stanford.edu/~kkaffes). At ETH Zürich, I am advised by [Prof. Lana Josipović](https://sites.google.com/view/lanajosipovic) and [Prof. Onur Mutlu](https://people.inf.ethz.ch/omutlu/). My broad area of research is Computing Systems, focusing on energy-efficiency and security. 

In a previous life, I worked at Oracle Corporation for three years after earning a Bachelor’s in Electrical Engineering (Hons.) from [BITS Pilani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birla_Institute_of_Technology_and_Science,_Pilani). I developed a taste for academia while working on my bachelor's thesis at the [Vienna University of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TU_Wien) (supervised by [Prof. Muhammad Shafique](https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/academics/divisions/engineering/faculty/muhammad-shafique.html) and [Prof. Surekha Bhanot](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/Pilani/surekha/profile)). 
<!-- My prior research focuses on Non-Volatile Memory microarchitectures for accelerating deep learning. -->
