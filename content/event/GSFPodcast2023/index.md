- **Upload** an existing slide deck to `static/` and link using `url_slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Embed** your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using [shortcodes](https://wowchemy.com/docs/writing-markdown-latex/).

Further event details, including [page elements](https://wowchemy.com/docs/writing-markdown-latex/) such as image galleries, can be added to the body of this page. -->

It was a lot of fun to dive into these challenges with Hongyu HÃ¨ and Chris Adams on the [Environment Variables](https://podcasts.bcast.fm/e/vn50x748-the-week-in-green-software-green-kernels) podcast hosted by the [Green Software Foundation](https://greensoftware.foundation/)!
