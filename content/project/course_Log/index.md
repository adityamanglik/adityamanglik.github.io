## Machine Learning

I feel ML and AI represent tremendous potential for all future possibilities. However, it is critical that we treat the biology-inspired algorithms in a way that nature handles and processes them. There is a critical need to design new systems of the future which can handle the enourmous computation power needed to run these algorithms. I wish to be the master of the same.
