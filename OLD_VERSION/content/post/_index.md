I enjoy learning about new hardware and software developments. I also like to help others understand these developments and their potential applications in the simplest, yet complete forms. I have a dream of unifying and archiving all knowledge sources in this world and making knowledge available to everybody.

This blog serves to record my ideas, ramblings, and progress for various projects, and to constantly give back to others what I learn. One of the purposes of this blog is to simplify the learning process for others who might face problems similar to what I faced or might do similar projects, and aggregate all content in a single place for easy reference. I hope it serves you a greater purpose than it does mine.
